# Cake-Time

This is a beginner-level coding project to create an Alexa skill that teaches her to remember your birthday, provide a countdown to your next, and wish you a happy birthday the
day of. I have always had an interest in software, but limited coding experience, and used this as an entry-point to dip my toes into the water. I plan to become more proficient 
in general for my own personal projects, but wanted to start with a well established product, and easy to follow basic instructions. In the future I hope to learn at least two
languages, and start my own experiments with Linux.
